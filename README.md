# Permison-De Leon_MD5 HASHING ALGORITHM

### Program Name: MarkRenz*MD5 Hashing*

**Author:** Mark Denzel J. Permison & Clarence Benedict De Leon

**Date:** 09/22/2024 - 09/23/2024

**Version:** 1.0.2

**Purpose:** Calculates a fixed-length, 128-bit hash value from a given user input message. This process involves taking the input data, regardless of its size, and transforming it into a unique string of digits and letters that serves as a digital fingerprint.

<br>
<br>

## System Requirements
**Hardware(Minimum):**

* **CPU:** Single-core or dual-core processor (Intel Pentium or AMD Ryzen 3)
* **Ram:** 1 Gb 
* **Storage:** At least 300 MB available.


### Software:
* **Operating system:** Windows or Linux
* **Browser:** Google, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Brave, etc... 
* **Python Version:** Python 3.11.2
* **Libraries:** *Django & Hashlib*

<br>

## Functional Description
* **Input:** You use the textbox labeled ***Input Message:*** to enter a message or unique word. There is no limit on the length of the input. For example, you can enter an entire email in the textbox, such as Thisisanemail@emaildomain.com.
* **Processing:** The program utilizes a mathematical hashing algorithm to convert the input data into a unique hexadecimal hash string. This process begins by appending a '1' bit to the end of the message, followed by enough '0' bits to ensure the total length reaches 448 bits, which is 64 bits short of the next multiple of 512. Subsequently, the last 64 bits of the input are reserved to store the original message length. After the input has been properly padded, the MD5 algorithm processes it to produce a fixed output of 128 bits, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. Once it has been outputted into its unique line of string it cannot be processed back into the original string.
* **Output:** The output is displayed in the textarea labeled ***Output:*** as a string of hexadecimal hash, for example, a1d61919bb9a68b1ad6cde6c50524481. This is an example of the output generated by the process. As you can see, it is unreadable to the human eye. This series of hash ***CANNOT be reverted back into its original message.***

## Security Considerations
**Vulnerability Assessment:**
+ MD5:
    * MD5 is considered weak and susceptible to collision attacks. It should not be used for secure hashing of sensitive data like passwords.
    * MD5 is fast, which makes it easier for attackers to perform brute-force attacks.
+ Program:
    * Outdated libraries may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromises.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
+ MD5:
    * Since MD5 is not suitable for hashing sensitive information (e.g., passwords), switch to more secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt.
    * You may also put a unique salt for each password to ensure that identical passwords do not result in the same hash.
+ Program:
    * We regularly monitor our third-party packages for vulnerabilities using tools like pip-audit, ensuring that no outdated or insecure libraries compromise our system.
    * We regularly update Django and its dependencies to the latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

**Testing:**
+ MD5:
    * We are conducting regular tests of our *MD5 hashing* program to ensure its consistency.

## Usage Instructions
**Installations:**
* **Step 1:** Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **Step 2:** [Download this folder](https://github.com/Mark-Denzel/markrenzhashing/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
* **Step 3:** After the folder is downloaded, a pop-up will appear. Click then hold and drag the *markrenzhashing-main* folder to the C:\ drive.
* **Step 4:** If you don't have Django, open Command Prompt and copy and paste this --> pip install django.
* **Step 5:** Make sure your Django is updated with version 5.1.1. To check this, open Command Prompt and copy & paste this --> python -m django --version. If not updated copy & paste this to Command Prompt --> pip install --upgrade Django

**Configurations:**
* The Python version is at least --> Python 3.11.2 or Higher
* Django version 5.1.1

**Execution:**
* To execute the program, first double-click the *run.bat* file included in the *markrenzhashing-main* folder. ***Note: Make sure that you have installed the Django library***
* After the batch file has executed, you will see a URL or HTTP link. Then, use Ctrl + Right Click to open the link. --> [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
* To stop the server just  Ctrl + C
* *Note: Before clicking the link, ensure that the server is running; otherwise, you will see the error message "This site canâ€™t be reached."*

## Error Handling
**Error Codes & Recovery Procedures:**
+ **Error 1:** When you *run.bat* file and it doesn't response/automatically close or you manually try to open the server using CMD:

+ **Error 2:** You encountered this error:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f98a45-22cc-44d7-87cd-a9e69dd882b4)

     * Solution: Just type "pip install django" in CMD. Then try to open the *run.bat* file, if there is a windows security warning, click *more info* and *run annyway*.
 
+ **Error 2:** When you click/go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and this error shows up:

  <img width="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/424a6e84-7adb-409f-ad56-25336af5afed">

     * Solution: Go to the markrenzhashing-main folder that you recently downloaded, find the run.bat file, and double-click it to open the server.

## Maintenance Log
### **Date:** 09/23/2024
   * **Author:** Clarence Benedict De Leon
   * **Changes:** Modified the input and output text areas to be fixed, preventing them from overlapping the container. To achieve this, we set textarea {resize: none;}

### **Date:** 09/24/2024
   * **Author:** Mark Denzel J. Permison
   * **Changes:** I modified the title, adjusted the button sizes, and labeled the input and output text boxes.
